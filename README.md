## CSV File Structure üìÇ

The application uses a CSV file named `contacts.csv` to store contact details. Each row in the file represents a contact with the following fields:

- **Name**: The contact's name.
- **Phone**: The contact's phone number.
- **Email**: The contact's email address.

If the file does not exist, it will be created automatically when saving contacts.

## Requirements üìã

- Python 3.6 or higher.

No additional libraries are required as the project relies on Python's built-in `csv` and `os` modules.
